# Overview

Koffi is a fast and easy-to-use C FFI module for Node.js, featuring:

* Low-overhead and fast performance (see [benchmarks](https://koffi.dev/benchmarks))
* Support for primitive and aggregate data types (structs and fixed-size arrays), both by reference (pointer) and by value
* Javascript functions can be used as C callbacks (since 1.2.0)
* Well-tested code base for popular OS/architecture combinations

The following combinations of OS and architectures __are officially supported and tested__ at the moment:

ISA / OS           | Windows     | Linux    | macOS       | FreeBSD     | OpenBSD
------------------ | ----------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------
x86 (IA32) [^1]    | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚¨úÔ∏è *N/A*    | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes
x86_64 (AMD64)     | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes
ARM32 LE [^2]      | ‚¨úÔ∏è *N/A*    | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚¨úÔ∏è *N/A*    | üü® Probably | üü® Probably
ARM64 (AArch64) LE | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes      | üü® Probably
RISC-V 64 [^3]     | ‚¨úÔ∏è *N/A*    | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚¨úÔ∏è *N/A*    | üü® Probably | üü® Probably

[^1]: The following call conventions are supported: cdecl, stdcall, MS fastcall, thiscall.
[^2]: The prebuilt binary uses the hard float ABI and expects a VFP coprocessor. Build from source to use Koffi with a different ABI (softfp, soft).
[^3]: The prebuilt binary uses the LP64D (double-precision float) ABI. The LP64 ABI is supported in theory if you build Koffi from source but this is untested. The LP64F ABI is not supported.

# Source code

This repository does not contain the code of Koffi but only exists as a front. For pratical reasons, I've started using a single repository for all my projects in 2018 because it is easier to manage.

The source code is available here: https://codeberg.org/Koromix/rygel/ (in the *src/koffi* subdirectory).

Monorepositories have two killer features for me:

* Cross-project refactoring
* Simplified dependency management

You can find a more detailed rationale here: https://danluu.com/monorepo/

# Build manually

Koffi is built with a custom CMake-wrapper called CNoke, which also lives in the monorepository. Don't try to run CMake manually because it will fail.

Follow the [documented build instructions](https://koffi.dev/contribute#build-from-source) to build Koffi from source.
